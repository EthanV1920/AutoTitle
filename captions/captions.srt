00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,460
hello my friend I've got a personal

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,059
question for you today and that is how

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,500
old are you on the inside now before you

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,960
get offended that I'm asking people's

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,420
age I don't really care chronologically

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,080
how old are you I'm asking how mature

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,119
are you see I've met 55 year olds that

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,939
really on the inside they're 15 year

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,920
olds I mean the way they handle conflict

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,140
um the way that they actually conduct

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
themselves in business and and

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,420
Partnerships and they're just immature

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
they've got that selfishness that is a

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,840
part of growing up and I've met 15 year

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,719
old students

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,200
great discernment tough resilient

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,660
grace-filled inner Souls your age does

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,579
not predict your maturity level your

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,000
maturity level tells me your maturity

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,460
level how are you doing immaturity

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,620
what if for a minute you just thought

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,680
about your maturity level let's define

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,140
maturity maturity is the ability to

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,960
handle difficult situations with

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,580
emotional health I'll say that again

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,060
maturity is the ability to handle

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,799
difficult situations with emotional

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,520
health or another way we might Define

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,159
maturity is maturity is applying God's

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,880
truth when you don't feel like it

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,220
it's providing truth and Grace in the

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,680
moments when you really want to

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,000
overreact with selfishness and ego and

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,500
defense

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,600
this is a big issue with the Apostle

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,119
Paul he writes a lot about it to these

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,100
young mostly immature churches that he

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,439
starts one of my favorite places it has

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,579
Ephesians chapter four I'm gonna read a

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,100
little bit more scripture than we

41
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,259
normally do on the refill book but just

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,360
let this kind of sink into your soul

43
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,299
today as you get your day going so

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,000
Ephesians 4 11-16 here's Paul talking

45
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,439
about maturity so Christ himself gave

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,119
the apostles the prophets the

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,700
evangelists the pastors and the teachers

48
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,219
to equip his people for works of service

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,640
so that the body of Christ might be

50
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,920
built up until we all reach unity in the

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,040
faith and the knowledge of the Son of

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,319
God and become mature attaining to the

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,020
whole measure of the fullness of Christ

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,300
now we read this passage we think oh

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,819
this is like taking the Enneagram in my

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,860
pastor am I a teacher in my Apostle

57
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,360
that's not the meaning at all the

58
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,020
meaning of this passage is simply this

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,520
God gave the church lots of gifts so

60
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,580
you'll grow up

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,640
God gave pastors teachers prophets

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,459
Apostles why so that we become Unity

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,400
unified that's the sign of maturity and

64
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,160
that that we all be built up to grow up

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
God gave us lots of gifts where others

66
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,620
gets found in the church

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,019
verse 14 then once all those gifts get

68
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,819
into our life we will no longer be

69
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,739
infants tossed back and forth by the

70
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,720
waves and blown here and there by every

71
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,879
wind of teaching and by the cunning and

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,980
craftiness of people in their deceitful

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,540
scheming so the first idea is God gives

74
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,720
us a ton of gifts so we could become

75
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,540
mature the second idea is if we apply

76
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,519
those gifts consistently our life

77
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,040
becomes more stable

78
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,019
we're not tiles back and forth one of

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,000
the signs of mature life is they remain

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,280
stable they're not toused back and forth

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,099
so first of all you access the gifts at

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,080
church you apply them consistently and

83
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,340
your life will be stable is your life

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,360
stable right now

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,459
maybe you need to like get into really

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,500
get into church so that the gifts there

87
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,239
apply to you and then do that

88
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,220
consistently don't walk away when it's

89
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,900
hard don't stop during summer because

90
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,980
you got to go to Tahoe or this or that

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,540
get into those gifts that God provides

92
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,099
and watch that stability be built okay

93
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,680
one last thought I'll let you go for the

94
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,500
day instead of being tossed back and

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,980
forth speaking the truth and love we

96
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,319
will grow to become in every respect the

97
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,780
mature body of him who is the head that

98
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,459
is Christ from him the whole body joined

99
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,879
and held together by every supporting

100
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:13,980
ligament grows and builds itself up in

101
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,780
love as each part does its work so Paul

102
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,280
goes 360 here there's so much of this

103
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,160
passage I can't cover but just one big

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,959
thought he goes 360 here he goes God

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,020
gives all these gifts

106
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,100
you applying consistently and guess what

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,440
you become

108
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,020
you become one of the gifts

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,120
if you actually let those gifts that God

110
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,419
has given the church get into you you

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,120
become stable and then your position to

112
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,220
give your gifts in love

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,160
to other people in fact Paul says this

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,540
any church can grow any church can grow

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,580
no matter how difficult their

116
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,660
circumstance is if two things will

117
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,139
happen

118
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,620
number one people will practice their

119
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:58,320
gifts on each other and number two

120
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,060
they'll practice those gifts in love

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
are you letting the gifts that God has

122
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,500
given the church really get into your

123
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
life are you letting that happen

124
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,560
consistently are you seeing stability

125
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,020
from that

126
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,199
and are you turning around and sharing

127
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,139
those gifts with others if you do I

128
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,600
don't care if you're 15 or 55 you'll

129
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,080
grow in maturity you'll grow in

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,320
stability and you will be my friend a

131
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,320
wonderful gift to others

132
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,320
foreign
