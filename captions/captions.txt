hello my friend I've got a personal

question for you today and that is how

old are you on the inside now before you

get offended that I'm asking people's

age I don't really care chronologically

how old are you I'm asking how mature

are you see I've met 55 year olds that

really on the inside they're 15 year

olds I mean the way they handle conflict

um the way that they actually conduct

themselves in business and and

Partnerships and they're just immature

they've got that selfishness that is a

part of growing up and I've met 15 year

old students

great discernment tough resilient

grace-filled inner Souls your age does

not predict your maturity level your

maturity level tells me your maturity

level how are you doing immaturity

what if for a minute you just thought

about your maturity level let's define

maturity maturity is the ability to

handle difficult situations with

emotional health I'll say that again

maturity is the ability to handle

difficult situations with emotional

health or another way we might Define

maturity is maturity is applying God's

truth when you don't feel like it

it's providing truth and Grace in the

moments when you really want to

overreact with selfishness and ego and

defense

this is a big issue with the Apostle

Paul he writes a lot about it to these

young mostly immature churches that he

starts one of my favorite places it has

Ephesians chapter four I'm gonna read a

little bit more scripture than we

normally do on the refill book but just

let this kind of sink into your soul

today as you get your day going so

Ephesians 4 11-16 here's Paul talking

about maturity so Christ himself gave

the apostles the prophets the

evangelists the pastors and the teachers

to equip his people for works of service

so that the body of Christ might be

built up until we all reach unity in the

faith and the knowledge of the Son of

God and become mature attaining to the

whole measure of the fullness of Christ

now we read this passage we think oh

this is like taking the Enneagram in my

pastor am I a teacher in my Apostle

that's not the meaning at all the

meaning of this passage is simply this

God gave the church lots of gifts so

you'll grow up

God gave pastors teachers prophets

Apostles why so that we become Unity

unified that's the sign of maturity and

that that we all be built up to grow up

God gave us lots of gifts where others

gets found in the church

verse 14 then once all those gifts get

into our life we will no longer be

infants tossed back and forth by the

waves and blown here and there by every

wind of teaching and by the cunning and

craftiness of people in their deceitful

scheming so the first idea is God gives

us a ton of gifts so we could become

mature the second idea is if we apply

those gifts consistently our life

becomes more stable

we're not tiles back and forth one of

the signs of mature life is they remain

stable they're not toused back and forth

so first of all you access the gifts at

church you apply them consistently and

your life will be stable is your life

stable right now

maybe you need to like get into really

get into church so that the gifts there

apply to you and then do that

consistently don't walk away when it's

hard don't stop during summer because

you got to go to Tahoe or this or that

get into those gifts that God provides

and watch that stability be built okay

one last thought I'll let you go for the

day instead of being tossed back and

forth speaking the truth and love we

will grow to become in every respect the

mature body of him who is the head that

is Christ from him the whole body joined

and held together by every supporting

ligament grows and builds itself up in

love as each part does its work so Paul

goes 360 here there's so much of this

passage I can't cover but just one big

thought he goes 360 here he goes God

gives all these gifts

you applying consistently and guess what

you become

you become one of the gifts

if you actually let those gifts that God

has given the church get into you you

become stable and then your position to

give your gifts in love

to other people in fact Paul says this

any church can grow any church can grow

no matter how difficult their

circumstance is if two things will

happen

number one people will practice their

gifts on each other and number two

they'll practice those gifts in love

are you letting the gifts that God has

given the church really get into your

life are you letting that happen

consistently are you seeing stability

from that

and are you turning around and sharing

those gifts with others if you do I

don't care if you're 15 or 55 you'll

grow in maturity you'll grow in

stability and you will be my friend a

wonderful gift to others
